## ImageNet Class Labels

**File**: `imagenet_classes.txt`

**Source**: ImageNet class labels
**Dataset**: ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)

**Note**: The class labels are factual data and are provided for reference purposes. The ImageNet dataset itself has specific terms of use. For more information, visit: http://www.image-net.org/

## Model Formats

All models in this directory are in ExecuTorch format (`.pte` files), which are optimized versions of the original PyTorch models. The conversion to ExecuTorch format does not change the underlying model weights or architecture - only the serialization format for efficient on-device inference.

## Usage Guidelines

These models are provided for **demonstration and development purposes** in the executorch_flutter example application.

- **MobileNet V3**: Free to use for commercial and non-commercial purposes under BSD-3-Clause
- **YOLO Models**: Require AGPL-3.0 compliance OR an Ultralytics enterprise license for commercial use
- Always verify license compatibility with your intended use case before deployment

## Disclaimer

These pre-trained models are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The models are included solely for demonstration purposes to help developers understand how to use the executorch_flutter package. Users are responsible for ensuring their use of these models complies with all applicable licenses and regulations.
